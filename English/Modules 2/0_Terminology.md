# Terminology relevant to the sampling techniques

A list of terms relevant to the sampling and inference techniques are provided in the AREA2 documentation: https://area2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/definitions.html  Below are a few additional terms not included in the AREA2 documentation.  

#### Response design
Defined by (Stehman and Czaplewski, 1998)[^fn1]:  “The reference or ‘true’ classification is obtained for each sampling unit based on interpreting aerial photography or videography, a ground visit, or a combination of these sources. The methods used to determine this reference classification are called the ‘response design.’ The response design includes procedures to collect information pertaining to the reference land-cover determination, and rules for assigning one or more reference [labels] to each sampling unit.” Referred to as “measurement plan” by Särndal et al. (1992)[^fn2].

#### Sample
A subset of population units selected from the population.

#### Sample design
Synonymous with sampling design, which is the preferred term in the seminal literature (Cochran, 1977[^fn3], Särndal et al., 1992[^fn2]). The term occurs in Rice (1995)[^fn4] who uses both “sampling design” and “sample design”. 

#### Sampling design
“The sampling design is the protocol by which the reference sample units are selected.” (Stehman and Czaplewski, 1998)[^fn1]. “Sampling design” is also used by Cochran (1977)[^fn3] and Särndal et al. (1992)[^fn2] -- the former also uses “sampling plan”. 

#### Survey
Särndal et al. (1992)[^fn2] defines a survey as a “partial investigation of a finite population”, and further that “that the terms ‘survey’ and ‘sample survey’ are used to denote statistical investigations with the following methodological features: [...] probability sampling [...] measurement plan [and] estimation”


#### Survey design
A “total survey design” defines the procedures for “obtaining the possible precision in the survey estimates while striking a balance between sampling and non-sampling errors [...] The survey design gives rise to survey operations” such as sample selection (Särndal et al., 1992)[^fn2]. Lohr (1999)[^fn5] describes a total survey design as “A philosophy of survey design for minimizing nonsampling as well as sampling errors.” Also, in Lohr (1999) “survey design” is synonymous with sampling design.
